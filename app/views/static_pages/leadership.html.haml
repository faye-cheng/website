				%h2 Hackathon Co-Founder
				%p
					Along with a fellow classmate, we created the first hackathon at Mills College at our university. We are a liberal arts institution, and we wanted to celebrate the Interdisciplinary nature of our CS program -- thus inviting participants from all backgrounds, especially non-technical, to think of ways that technology can be used to help social causes in other disciplines.

Employed App Inventor to teach first-generation college students how to build mobile applications to solve social issues.

					As one of the DMT's selected to assist the Aldi expansion into California, I trained in Chicago, IL where I learned the various facets of the business and the many responsibilities of Aldi employees to become an effective business leader.
