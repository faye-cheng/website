			I'm a graduate student at Mills College studying Computer Science. I began as a Sociology major interested in entrepreneurship and business, who soon discovered my love for programming and creating new products.

			%b What makes me different?
			I have a very diverse skillset that allows me to contribute to multiple facets of a project. In addition to being a programmer, I am a writer, artist, a meticulous organizer, public speaker, and a star team member. I love growing products, and learning the technologies to bring start-up ideas to life. I enjoy using my analytical abilities to come up with ideas and innovation solutions, and I pride myself in being creative and resourceful in tackling difficult challenges.
