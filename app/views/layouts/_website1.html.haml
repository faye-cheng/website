	.projectDescription
		%h3 Description
		%p I wanted to create a personal website from scratch, and created this Rails App as a side project. I really enjoyed experimenting with javascript, further expanding my development skills, and modifying code elements to implement site features successfully. I also wanted to focus on creating a simple and elegant UX design.

		%h3 Product
		%p It is my hope that visitors to my site will be able to get a good idea of my programming and design skills, my personal experiences, and assess my potential as a Software Engineer and Product Manager.
