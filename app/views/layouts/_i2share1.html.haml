	.projectDescription
		%h3 Description
		%p I am the primary front-end developer for the start-up, i2share. As a team of 4, we worked to develop our product concept and implement our Rails App using a vagrant environment and git for version control. We held weekly scrum meetings to discuss progress and upcoming tasks, and user testing to guide our design and development. I also worked closely with the back-end team.
		%h3 Product
		%p i2share is a platform that allows users to easily share their personal projects with each other, with the ability to clone and contribute content to make it their own. We specialize in giving users the opportunity to upload Python game projects.
